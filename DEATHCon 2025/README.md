## 🎯 Workshop Overview

Welcome to the ultimate **Human vs AI Detection Engineering Challenge** at DEATHCon 2025! This hands-on workshop will pit human cybersecurity experts against PERSEPTOR AI in a real-time threat analysis and detection rule generation competition.

### 🏆 The Challenge

Participants will analyze a **secret threat intelligence report** that will be revealed at the start of the workshop. Your mission: extract intelligence and generate detection rules faster and more accurately than AI.

---

## 🎮 Workshop Format

### ⏰ Timeline
- **Duration:** 60 minutes
- **Format:** Live competition with streaming
- **Participants:** 512+ cybersecurity professionals
- **Challenge:** Real-time threat analysis and rule generation

### 🎯 Competition Phases

#### Phase 1: Manual Analysis (30 minutes)
**Human Intelligence Challenge**

You will receive a threat intelligence report URL at the start of the workshop. Your task is to manually analyze the report and extract:

1. **📋 Threat Summary**
   - Executive summary of the threat
   - Key findings and implications
   - Risk assessment

2. **🎯 Key TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)**
   - Attack methodologies
   - Behavioral patterns
   - Operational procedures

3. **🗺️ MITRE ATT&CK Techniques**
   - Technique IDs and names
   - Procedure examples
   - Detection opportunities

4. **🔍 IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)**
   - IP addresses
   - Domains and URLs
   - File hashes
   - Registry keys

5. **👤 Threat Actors**
   - Attribution information
   - Group characteristics
   - Historical activities

6. **🛠️ Tools & Malware**
   - Malware families
   - Tool identification
   - Capabilities and features

7. **📜 Detection Rules**
   - **Sigma Rules:** YAML-based detection rules
   - **YARA Rules:** Pattern-based signatures

#### Phase 2: SigmaHQ Integration (15 minutes)
**Advanced Detection Engineering**

After manual analysis, search SigmaHQ repository for existing rules that could detect the threat:

- Browse [SigmaHQ Rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)
- Identify relevant existing rules
- Document rule mappings and coverage gaps
- Suggest improvements or modifications

#### Phase 3: AI Comparison (15 minutes)
**Human vs AI Showdown**

Now it's time to see how AI performs:

1. **🤖 PERSEPTOR Analysis**
   - Enter your OpenAI API key
   - Input the threat report URL
   - Let PERSEPTOR analyze the same report

2. **📊 Comparison & Evaluation**
   - Compare your manual analysis with AI results
   - Evaluate accuracy and completeness
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses of each approach
