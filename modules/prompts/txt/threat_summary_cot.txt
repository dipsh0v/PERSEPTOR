Analyze the following threat report text using this step-by-step reasoning process:

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY THREAT CONTEXT:
Think about: What type of threat is described? (APT, ransomware, vulnerability exploitation, etc.)
Who are the likely targets? What is the threat actor's motivation?

STEP 2 - EXTRACT KEY FINDINGS:
Identify: CVEs/vulnerabilities with severity, targeted sectors/regions, campaign overview,
the attack narrative (how the attack unfolds from initial access to impact).

STEP 3 - ASSESS IMPACT:
Evaluate: What is the overall severity? What is the potential blast radius?
What defensive gaps does this exploit?

STEP 4 - RECOMMEND ACTIONS:
Determine: Immediate mitigations, detection priorities, long-term defensive improvements.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Plain text output only, no markdown formatting
- Maximum 300 words
- State "Not identified" for missing data points
- Be precise with technical details
- DO NOT list IoCs (IPs, domains, hashes, emails, file names) — they are extracted separately
- DO NOT list MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs or TTPs — they are mapped separately
- DO NOT list tools or malware family names as bullet points — they are extracted separately
- Focus on the NARRATIVE: what happened, who did it, why, how it impacts defenders, and what to do about it
