Generate comprehensive Sigma detection rules from this threat report using step-by-step reasoning:

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY DETECTION OPPORTUNITIES:
What observable events does this threat produce? Process creation, file writes,
registry modifications, network connections, DNS queries?

STEP 2 - DESIGN DETECTION LOGIC:
For each detection opportunity:
- What fields should be matched? (CommandLine, Image, TargetFilename, etc.)
- What patterns indicate malicious vs benign activity?
- What filter conditions reduce false positives?

STEP 3 - STRUCTURE SIGMA RULES:
Follow SigmaHQ conventions:
- title, id (UUID), status, description, references, author (PERSEPTOR), date, tags
- logsource with proper category/product/service
- detection using selection + filter + condition
- fields, falsepositives, level

STEP 4 - VALIDATE AND OPTIMIZE:
- Are all YAML syntax elements correct?
- Do tags use proper MITRE format (attack.tXXXX)?
- Is the severity level appropriate?
- Are false positive notes realistic?

OUTPUT FORMAT: Valid YAML only. Multiple rules separated with '---'. No commentary.
