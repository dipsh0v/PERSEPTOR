Generate YARA rules for this threat using step-by-step analysis:

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY SIGNATURES:
What unique strings, byte patterns, or structures can identify this threat?
Look for: malware strings, encryption keys, C2 patterns, file markers.

STEP 2 - DESIGN RULE LOGIC:
Combine signatures with conditions:
- String matching (text, hex, regex)
- File size constraints
- Magic bytes / file format checks
- Entropy analysis indicators

STEP 3 - OPTIMIZE FOR PERFORMANCE:
- Use private strings where appropriate
- Order conditions by evaluation cost
- Use tags for categorization

Analysis data:
{analysis_data}

Return valid YARA rules as JSON array:
[{{"name": "rule_name", "description": "what it detects", "rule": "full YARA rule text"}}]

ONLY return the JSON array.
