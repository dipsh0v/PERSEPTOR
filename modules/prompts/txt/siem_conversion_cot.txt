Convert these Sigma rules to platform-specific SIEM queries using this process.
You are a senior SOC engineer. Your queries will be DIRECTLY deployed in production SIEMs.
BAD QUERIES CAUSE PERFORMANCE ISSUES AND ALERT FATIGUE — be precise and efficient.

STEP 1 - PARSE SIGMA LOGIC:
Understand: What fields are referenced? What operators are used?
What is the detection condition logic? How many separate detection rules exist?

STEP 2 - MAP FIELD NAMES:
Sigma field -> Splunk field -> QRadar property -> Elastic field -> Sentinel table.column

STEP 3 - BUILD OPTIMIZED, PRODUCTION-READY QUERIES:
CRITICAL RULES FOR QUERY QUALITY:
- DO NOT combine all Sigma rules into a single massive monolithic query. Instead, create ONE focused query per Sigma rule or per logical detection group (max 3 related detections per query).
- Each query should be SHORT (under 40 lines), READABLE, and MAINTAINABLE.
- Use proper indentation and line breaks for readability.
- Include comments explaining each detection section.
- Splunk: Use proper index, sourcetype. Prefer simple search over tstats unless dealing with data model acceleration. Use `| where` for complex logic instead of cramming into search.
- QRadar: Use correct AQL syntax, LIMIT results, efficient WHERE clauses. Use START/STOP for time ranges.
- Elastic: Use proper index patterns, bool query with must/should/must_not. Return JSON DSL.
- Sentinel: Use appropriate table (SecurityEvent, DeviceProcessEvents), clean KQL with let statements for readability.

STEP 4 - ADD OPERATIONAL CONTEXT:
For each query include:
- A one-line description of what this query detects
- Expected log sources and required data onboarding
- Estimated noise level (low/medium/high) and tuning guidance
