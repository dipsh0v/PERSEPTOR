Generate a high-quality Sigma detection rule using this reasoning process:

STEP 1 - UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENT:
What threat behavior should be detected? What log sources are relevant?
What platforms should be supported?

STEP 2 - RESEARCH DETECTION APPROACH:
What MITRE ATT&CK techniques are involved? What detection strategies exist?
What are known false positive scenarios?

STEP 3 - DESIGN RULE:
Build the detection logic with:
- Precise field matching conditions
- Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT)
- Filter conditions for false positive reduction
- Appropriate severity rating

STEP 4 - QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
Evaluate: Detection quality, false positive risk, coverage completeness,
maintainability score.

STEP 5 - CREATE TEST CASES:
Design test scenarios that validate the rule works correctly.
